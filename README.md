PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite advancements in the travel industry, most people today judge a destination by word of mouth. But it
isn't always possible to find someone who's been to where you are to visit. And even if you can, their words
might not be enough to satisfy your curiosity. Also, the opinions of a single party may be biased, which makes
getting a second opinion vital.
People prefer the personal experiences of others who've been there; over facts & data, which explains why
vlogs and short reels are popular. But even after watching hours of videos and reels, one might not find the
results productive enough. Doing so would also require a lot of writing down notes as it’s not possible to go
through a whole video every time you want something, especially during a trip.

SOLUTION STATEMENT
We propose a platform where the user can know all about a location by watching the journeys of other users,
and discover local markets, street food, popular local spots etc that aren’t visible on Google but were still
visited and geotagged by our users. It will also be a place where people could upload pictures or videos and
have reviews and ratings for the location. This would allow the user to not depend on word of mouth but Know
about the location himself.

USP (UNIQUE SELLING POINT)
View the journeys (that were given public access) of other people who’ve been to the particular place that you
are planning to visit. See their journey for all sorts of details like popular spots they visited, best local cuisine
they tried, contact info of the cab driver/hotel manager/tour guide/restaurant food delivery who’s services they
used, good photoshoot spots(if they found any) etc information on tourist places(popular or not) that isn’t found
on google; ALL AT ONE PLACE. All you need is one person who’s been there before. Assess the credibility of
the information provided from the reviews and ratings section for the journey. Write your own reviews and
ratings to describe your own experience after the journey and testify on the behalf of the traveler.
